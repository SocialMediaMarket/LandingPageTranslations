            "content": "<p>Reaching the target audience is tricky, nowadays. Recent research shows that 47% of overall mobile and desktop internet users are now using ad-blocking software. This number has almost doubled in comparison to the previous year. Furthermore, 36% of traffic generated by Pay-per-click (PPC) campaigns are suspected to be fraudulent or non-human. Hence, brands are seeking new ways of advertising their products and services, discovering the power and realizing the importance of Influencer Marketing. <br><br> Social media platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter have seen explosive growth, connecting over 3.03 billion people every day. As the amount of time spent online rises globally, consumer behavior changes. Advertising campaigns continue to shift from traditional to digital marketing, and consequently, offline marketing isn’t as effective as it used to be. However, not all digital marketing strategies are effective in reaching consumers. In the past few years companies and agencies have discovered Influencer Marketing as the strategy with the most potential and return, with over 80% of them finding this strategy effective. <br><br> Still, Influencer Marketing remains a complicated process for both advertisers building their campaigns and influencers seeking a way to monetize their content. Obscure and uncertain price determination, insecure transactions, non-compliance with executed agreements, fraud, lack of control and unreliable analytic instruments create challenging ROI determination.
